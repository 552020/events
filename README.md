The general goal of the project is to better understand how events work.
The precise goal is to be able to modify [my first CRA react app](https://github.com/552020/hello-react) so that it chooses a random link from an preselection of links to which the user is redirected when "Learn React" is clicked.

The path of the journey. I went back to the lessons of the Codecademy course, that treat the events.
The different pages in this project are elaboration of exercises of the course.
